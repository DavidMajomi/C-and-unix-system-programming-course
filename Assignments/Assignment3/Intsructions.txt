Create a program that converts distances between Kilometer and Mile and temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Program Requirements
1. The program should prompt the user to select converting Distance or Temperature.
2. After choice selected, use a menu to allow the user to choose the conversion direction.
3. Input the information using 'scanf' and print the results of the conversion using 'printf'.
4. All your code should be contained in the main() function of your program.

Input Requirements
1. The temperature or distance input should be a real number.
2. The distance cannot be less than 0.0 or greater than 20000.1.
3. The temperature cannot be less than -110.0 or greater than 1000.0.

Output Requirements
1. The number should be formatted with two decimal points.
2. The output from the conversion should be easy to understand.
3. Output should send to standard output (screen).
